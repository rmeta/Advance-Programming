<p>Define a class to represent a point in a 2D plane. This class should have the following properties:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Constructor that takes <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates as parameters.</li>
    <li>After an instance of this class is created, the values of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> should not be modifiable but should be accessible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Define another class named <code>Circle</code> with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A <code>Point</code> instance representing the center of the circle.</li>
    <li>A radius value.</li>
    <li>Two methods to calculate and retrieve the circumference and area of the circle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Define a function outside these classes that takes two <code>Circle</code> instances as parameters and determines if they intersect. Assume that touching is also considered an intersection.</p>

<p>Include comments in your code explaining the difference between a method defined inside a class and a function defined outside of the class.</p>
